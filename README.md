# Quantifying Bias
An independent study project working on ways of quantifying network bias, using data from the [ProPublica analysis](https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis) of the COMPAS recidivism prediction algorithm.

# Using the Respository
This repository contains configuration for a virtual environment. To sart the virtual environment, run the following command from the same directory as the isvenv folder: `source isvenv/bin/activate`

# Data extraction
Extracting the data actually took way way longer than I thought it should since the csv files with the data had some issues, so I had to import the file into excel and fix it up there. Also, before running weighted k means I have to convert categorical to numerical data.
